## Overview - Google - The Gemma 3n Impact Challenge
Your mission is to leverage the unique capabilities of Gemma 3n to create a product that addresses a significant real-world challenge. Think bigger than a simple chatbot. How can a private, offline-first, multimodal model make a tangible difference in people's lives?
The future of AI is personal, private, and compact enough to run in the palm of your hand. With the launch of Gemma 3n, we are putting the next generation of on-device, multimodal AI into your hands. Now, we challenge you to use this groundbreaking technology to build products that create meaningful, positive change in the world.
This is your opportunity to tackle real-world problems in areas like accessibility, education, healthcare, environmental sustainability, and crisis response. With a total prize pool of $150,000, we're looking for projects that aren't just technically brilliant, but are truly built for impact.


### The Challenge: Your Mission to Build for Impact
Your mission is to leverage the unique capabilities of Gemma 3n to create a product that addresses a significant real-world challenge. Think bigger than a simple chatbot. How can a private, offline-first, multimodal model make a tangible difference in people's lives?

Consider products that:
1. Enhance Accessibility: Build tools for real-time translation or transcription for the hearing-impaired, or visual description apps for the blind.
2. Revolutionize Education: Create interactive, offline-ready learning experiences for students in low-connectivity regions.
3. Improve Health & Wellness: Develop on-device apps that can provide mental health support through voice analysis or act as a personal wellness coach.
4. Promote Environmental Sustainability: Design an app that uses image and audio recognition to identify local plant diseases, track biodiversity, or promote recycling.
5. Aid in Crisis Response: Build tools that can operate offline to provide critical information or facilitate communication during natural disasters.

### Judging Criteria
Your video demo will be the primary lens through which judges evaluate your project, with your writeup and code serving as verification and providing technical depth. Submissions will be scored based on the following criteria:

1. **Impact & Vision (40 points)**: As demonstrated in your video, how clearly and compellingly does your project address a significant real-world problem? Is the vision inspiring and does the solution have a tangible potential for positive change?
2. **Video Pitch & Storytelling (30 points)**: How exciting, engaging, and well-produced is the video? Does it tell a powerful story that captures the viewer's imagination? Does it clearly and effectively demonstrate the product in action, showcasing a great user experience? Does it have viral potential?
3. **Technical Depth & Execution (30 points)**: As verified by the code repository and writeup, how innovative is the use of Gemma 3n's unique features (on-device performance, multimodality, mix'n'match, etc.)? Is the technology real, functional, well-engineered, and not just faked for the demo?


### Evaluation
Your project will be judged primarily on your video demo. This is your chance to create something exciting, compelling, and with the potential to be seen by millions. We want to see the "wow" factor. Your video should tell a story, demonstrate the real-world impact of your product, and leave the judges inspired.

While the video is the star of the show, all projects must be backed by real, functional technology. The accompanying writeup and code repository will be used by our judges to verify that your product is not just a concept but a working proof-of-concept built on Gemma 3n.
